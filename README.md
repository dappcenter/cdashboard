Dashboard for DPoS delegate information, DPoS private addresses, Masternodes status, staking info and crypto Wallets.

An overview of all your important DPoS delegate information e.g. Rank, Amount of coins, Approval, Number of Votes and the difference of the last 24h. 
Also Masternode information, like when you receive the last amount of coins in your MN wallet. The same for Staking coins, last but not least, just crypto Wallets, like Bitcoin and Ethereum!
Crypto Dashboard is made to sort those things out and present you all your important information in one handy overview.


If you like this dashboard, please consider to vote for all the Dutch Pool delegates: "dutch_pool", "st3v3n", "kippers", "fnoufnou" and "thamar" and receive the high sharing percentage of 90% per delegate!

## Installing it

First clone the crypto dashboard repository, install python and requests:

```git clone https://github.com/dutchpool/cdashboard```

```cd cdashboard```

```apt-get install python3-pip```

```pip3 install requests```


## Configure it

To configure the Dashboard we need to fill in the configuration file. With this install you get an example json config_example.json with a lot of examples and a file "config_template.json" which you can use as the config.json and change with your own parameters and coin basic information. To prepare this: 

```cp config_emptytemplate.json config.json```

Note: Never fill in your private keys, the crypto dashboard doesnt need those, we only work with public addresses!!!

The parameters:
- cryptodashboard_file_version: internal check if version is correct for updates
- crunch_history: true or false; this will crunch the log file after 48 hours to only one sample a day
- logfile: the file where all gathered coin info is stored; default "cdashboard.json"; you can change the logfile name the way you like (handy for setting up multiple config files with multiple log files, using one python script)
- coins: section where the coin info is represented
   - identifier: coin identifier, can be any random name, can hold white spaces, but I suggest to keep it short
      - coin: coin name
      - node: DPoS coin node web address (only for the DPoS coins)
      - pubaddress: the public address of the coins wallet (never add your private address/seeds!!!)
      - cointype: options are: dpos_delegate, dpos_private, masternode, pos_staking and wallet
         - currently, dpos_delegate is the first section of the dashboard; second section: dpos_private, masternode, pos_staking; third section: crypto wallets like BTC, ETC etc.. If you want to change this, you can do this in the case-statement in the app.js.
      - exploreraddress: coin explorer web address (for all the cointypes, if the format of the DPoS coin for the explorer address is wallet.something_coin.xx; wallet will be replaced internally with explorer and you don't have to fill in the explorer parameter)
      - share_perc: if you want you can fill in your Delegate sharing percentage, it will be shown next to the percentage which is retrieved from the Dutch Pool verifier, if available. 
         - output values can be: 
            - forg? : delegate is not forging
            - n.a. : not available / info could not be retrieved


Example config.json:
```
{
  "cryptodashboard_file_version": 0.8,
  "crunch_history": true,
  "logfile": "cdashboard.json",
  "coins": {
    "LWF Thamar mainnet": {
      "coin": "LWF",
      "node": "https://wallet.lwf.io",
      "pubaddress": "567015584193522108LWF",
      "share_perc": "90",
      "cointype": "dpos_delegate"
    },
     "onzdutchpoolmainnet": {
      "coin": "ONZ",
      "node": "https://node10.onzcoin.com",
      "pubaddress": "ONZkL6Jm1MKGWnVzMzkJ8jwTxbQ8Cudqh1Hw",
      "exploreraddress": "https://explorer.onzcoin.com",
      "share_perc": "90",
      "cointype": "dpos_delegate"
    }
 }
}
```
Above is an indication of how the config.json must look like. We have included a config_example.json for inspiration and also an almost empty json (config_template.json ) which you can copy and use this as your starting point to fill all your coin info.


## Start it:

```python3 cryptodashboard.py```

or if you want to use another config file:

```python3 cryptodashboard.py -c config2.json```

It produces a file (if default) "cdashboard.json" with all the crypto dashboard information which can be presented with the included HTML setup. Tip: the 24h information will not show immediately.

You have to copy the "cdashboard.json" file to the /docs folder to let the website have access to the gathered coin information. 

We advise to run the cryptodashboard python script every hour to collect it's data. The cronjob to configure this (use crontab -e):

```
00 * * * * cd ~/cdashboard && python3 ~/cdashboard/cryptodashboard.py
10 * * * * cd ~/cdashboard && cp cdashboard.json docs/cdashboard.json
```

You can also create a bash script with the above information if you prefer.
When the cdashboard script is ready and configured; you can setup the web environment to show the dashboard, see the setup file "cdashboard_site_setup.md".

## Command line usage

```
usage: cryptodashboard.py [-h] [-c config.json] [-y]

Crypto dashboard script

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c config.json        set a config file (default: config.json)

```


## Supported/tested chains / explorers

At the moment CryptDashboard supports and is tested on the following chains / explorers:
- DPoS:  LWF, ONZ, LISK, ARK, SHIFT, RISE, RipaEx
- Crypto wallets: all clones of Iquidus Explorer

Known issues:
- a lot of explorer chains are not supported yet; working on it!
- chainz.cryptoid.info - basic info is working, no last TX and date-received

## Changelog

###### Release 0.95
New feature:
- Added Lisk support (dashboard is now integrated with Lisk API 1.0)
- removed OXY references, since it is no DPoS anymore
- known issue: the pop-up only should show info from the coin which was selected; currently it shows all the coins.
- known issue: the history and 24 update functionality is still not working as expected.

###### Release 0.9/0.91
New feature:
- check your DPoS (private) addresses, if all your voted delegates are still forging!
- fixed some bugs for addresses which are brand new with no transactions jet.
- known issue: the pop-up only should show info from the coin which was selected; currently it shows all the coins.

###### Release 0.8
- Bugfix and feature release
	- Log cruncher is working!
	- Better suport for BTC and ETC;
	- integration between Dutch Pool verifier for overview of sharing %
	- a lot off small bugs
###### Release 0.6
- Initial release
	- basic support for coin explorers (e.g. BTC and ETC); more needs to be done!


## To Do
We are planning to integrate other cool features:
- show the voted delegates of one wallet with their percentages that they are paying in the pop-up 
- in the HTML overview, select the history period with a dropdown, now it is 24h and 48h;
- add a live indication in the DPoS main dashboard, the time until a node will forge
- add euro / dollar for amount of coins - If already possible! Not main focus currently
- create a web interface to maintain the config.json for adding, removing, adjusting coin info.
- create an HTML with main focus Masternodes instead of DPoS
